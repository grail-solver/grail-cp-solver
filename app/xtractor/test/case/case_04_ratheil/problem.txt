It is a multi-item, single machine problem with capacity of production limited to one per period. There are storage costs and sequence-dependent changeover costs, respecting the triangle inequality. Each order consisting of one unit of a particular item has a due date and must be produced at latest by its due date. The stocking (inventory) cost of an order is proportional to the number of periods between the due date and the production period. The changeover cost qi,j
 is induced when passing from the production of item i
 to another one j
 with qi,i=0,∀i
. Here, backlogging is not allowed. The objective is to assign a production period for each order respecting its due date and the machine capacity constraint so as to minimize the sum of stocking costs and changeover costs.

Example : Consider the problem with the following input data: number of items type nbItems=2
; number of periods nbPeriods=5
; stocking cost h=2
; demand times for items of type 1 d1t∈1,…,5=(0,1,0,0,1)
 and for items of type 2 d2t∈1,…,5=(1,0,0,0,1)
; q1,2=5
, q2,1=3
. A feasible solution of this problem is productionPlan=(2,1,2,0,1)
 which means that item 2
 will be produced in period 1
; item 1
 in period 2
; item 2
 in period 3
 and item 1
 in period 5
. Note that there is no production in period 4
, it is an idle period. The cost associated to this solution is q2,1+q1,2+q2,1+2∗h=15
 but it is not the optimal cost. The optimal solution is productionPlan=(2,1,0,1,2)
 with the cost q2,1+q1,2+h=10
